## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js

### What I learned

- How to Install the "React Developer Tools" Google chrome extension to aid troubleshooting while building  
- How to import icons into React  
- That the useState hook is basically React's alternative to variables in Vanilla JavaScript  
- About React.Fragment and its shortcut syntax <></>  
- More understanding on useEffect to manipulate other variables outside React's control  
- For this app was basically just breaking code down into bits and pieces and digesting from the master [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmDNBEdHzVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmDNBEdHzVs). But proudly refactored originally though by using Date.now() to generate keys so they're truly all unique even when manipulated. Note that there's however room to refactor code into smaller components.  
- This project was a handful, and I think I need numerous more lighter practice so I can better independently build.  

### Continued development

- More React apps!
